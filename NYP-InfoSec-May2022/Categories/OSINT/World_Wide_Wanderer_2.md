## Solution

1. Continuing from the pastebin with the flag for World Wide Wanderer 1, the description reads:
```
We need a plan to travel across Asia since it is a huge continent.
Please provide us with your wisdom and prowess to calculate how far do I need to walk in a straight line, from The Dome of the Rock to Kaaba.
Convert the distance to nearest kilometer and search for that Point number on the Asia continent.
Tip: If you can't find the correct Point, just +-1 or +-2 of the result you got until you find the correct point.
```
2. To do that, we head over to google maps and plant a point (left click) at The Dome, then right click and select measure distance.
3. We place another point at Kabba and google maps tells us the distance is about 1238km.
4. Looking for point 1238 on the map in Asia, brings us to a location in lebanon with the pastebin that leads us to the flag: https://pastebin.com/RpWB4vRv
