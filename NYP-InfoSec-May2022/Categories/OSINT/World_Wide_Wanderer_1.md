# Solution

1. By simply searching in google We find out that the place is Punggol. There is only one point in Punggol so we click on it (Point 1966).
2. In the description of Point 1966, there is a pastebin link: https://pastebin.com/6n14hutr.
3. The pastebin text says:
```
First adventure:
I've found the Budapest Hotel that does not reside in Budapest... It still looks pretty nice , hope to see you there!
 
Note: Find the location of the Budapest Hotel on the Google Maps link provided. Photo of the hotel is on the pin that led you to this site.
```
4. We search for budapest hotel in google maps: https://www.google.com/maps/search/budapest+hotel/@-29.1713905,-55.4839093,6z?hl=en-GB
5. After scrolling through the options, we find one with the same image as the one on point 1966
6. Clicking on it tells us that the budapest hotel is located in Island Ring Road Anabar, Nauru.
7. We visit this location in the map and find point 368 which leads to another pastebin link: https://pastebin.com/rCj6vEtf, with the flag in the text.
