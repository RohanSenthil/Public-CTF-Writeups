## Solution

1. Continuing from the pastebin with the flag for World Wide Wandere 2, the description reads:
```
Third Journey:
Let's take a break and step out of Google Maps for a second.
I've heard of an incredible collaborative project and social experiment with the name 'place', where people work with a canvas on a popular social media platform. I've also heard you may need '13:57 764,284' and '82:03 1930,140'. Come back when you found it!
 
NOTE: All flags are in the Google Map Link provided!
```
2. Searching for place and canvas eventually brings us to https://www.reddit.com/r/place/
3. There is a 'view canvas history' button on the banner of the r/place home page, we click it to view the canvas
4. If we adjust the timeline and move to the right positions ('13:57 764,284' and '82:03 1930,140'), we will find the numbers 198 and the flag of Latvia
5. There is however no point 198 in Latvia on the map and searching 198 Latvia thus not produce any useful results, however after thinking for a while, Latvia is in the continent Europe and there is a point 198 in Europe.
6. Heading over to point 198 in Europe brings us to the pastebin with the flag: https://pastebin.com/wdmnVu6L
