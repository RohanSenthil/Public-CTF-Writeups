## Solution
1. From Walking In The Dead 2, we got ```sharing&ouid=115932714019779054721&rtpof=true&sd=true``` and the code ```YOUFOUNDTHECODEL2CODE_DRIVE?```
2. We attach ```sharing&ouid=115932714019779054721&rtpof=true&sd=true``` to the google docs link from Walking In The Dead 2: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8Z8EzqRGgjTy4uKB8JZwhb89ohlmvEC/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115932714019779054721&rtpof=true&sd=true
3. We are prompted with a passcode, which is ```YOUFOUNDTHECODEL2CODE_DRIVE?```
4. After unlocking the document we are presented with the flag (Just need to add NYP).
```
Flag: NYP{YOUARETHEBEST}
```
