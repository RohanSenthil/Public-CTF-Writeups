# Alien Waves [428 Points]

Seriously? Right after the zombie outbreak, the aliens want to take over the earth? Luckily, you managed to intercept this audio file from the aliens. Investigate to see if you can find anything suspicious.

NOTE TO PARTICIPANTS! Turn down your volume before playing the audio file

Attached is a .wav file

## Solution
1. We open the .wav file with audacity
2. We then select the Spectogram view instead of the Waveform view at the dropdown arrow beside the name of the file (since CTF challenge authors love to encode text into audio waveforms, which you can see using the spectogram view)
3. We can now see the flag
```
Flag: NYP{s3cr3t-hidd3n-audio-m3ssag3-8142}
```
