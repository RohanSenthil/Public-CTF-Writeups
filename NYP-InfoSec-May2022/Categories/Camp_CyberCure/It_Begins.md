# Camp CyberCure: It Begins [328 Points]

Given a drawing of the satelitte view of a store and ts unit number, I am tasked to find the store's plus code.

## Solution

Since store was inside a MRT station, I opened google maps and selected the different MRT lines, following their paths until I found the MRT station that looked like
the one in the drawing.    

I then searched up the store unit number and the MRT station on google, found out it was Giant at Kranji MRT station and obtained its plus code
from google maps.
